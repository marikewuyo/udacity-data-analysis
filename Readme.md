## Dataset

The dataset consists of information on over a hundred thousand (100,000) medical appointments in Brazil's hospitals, with columns identifying specific characterisitics of the patients that booked the appointments (patientid, appointmentid, gender, scheduledday, appointmentday, age, neighbourhood, scholarship, hipertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handcap, sms_received and no_show). The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariks90/cleaned-brazil-may2016-noshow-medical-appointments).

## Summary of Findings

The exploration and wrangling process saw me verify the dataset, including the shape, datatype information, existence of null values, as well as summary statistics. After data wrangling, further exploration into the dataset showed the impact of specific patient's characteristics on their keeping or missing appointments. The research work was analysed within the clear bounds of descriptive statistical tools including the Histogram, Pie Chart and the Bar Chart. As such, the results are limited, and only serve to create a general outlook on the dataset.

## Key Insights

The focus here is on the appointments as the central feature, and on the other characteristics of the patient, which are the age, gender, neighbourhood, sms received, days of scheduling and appointments, and the Bolsa Familia Welfare Scholarship Program.
